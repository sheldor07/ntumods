Yet a significant number of organizations reported a high failure rate in driving change initiatives. The process of change and the resistance to change, if not well managed, could result in unproductive work or even unintended negative consequences.  The disappointing outcomes occurred because changes often affected multiple levels, from individuals? mindset, group routines, to organizational inertia.  Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such risks and increase the probability of successful change implementation.  Organizational leaders, together with their human resource practitioners, are often involved in the planning and executing of change for their teams and organizations.  \n\nThis course aims to equip seminar participants with the necessary knowledge of the different forms of change that take place in organizations, and the processes entailed in leading and managing change. Using seminars and discussion groups, the course will cover change management frameworks and concepts, explore the nature and context of change, examine alternative change management approaches and examine how best to implement predetermined change strategies, especially in the context of digital disruption."

Initially thought to be a random and intractable process, studies have shown that the aging process is regulated by evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways. Much of what we know about aging today comes from studying how C. elegans ages in the laboratory. With a life span of a little over two weeks, C. elegans is perfect for providing a quick view of the aging process. These microscopic roundworms display visible signs of aging where they slow down, stop reproducing and even develop wrinkled skin. This course aims to provide undergraduate students opportunities for in-depth learning and training in conducting experiments for studying biology of aging in worms focusing on experimental design, skill-sets, data acquisitions and analyses.

The disappointing outcomes occurred because changes often affected multiple levels, from individuals? mindset, group routines, to organizational inertia.  Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such risks and increase the probability of successful change implementation.  Organizational leaders, together with their human resource practitioners, are often involved in the planning and executing of change for their teams and organizations.  \n\nThis course aims to equip seminar participants with the necessary knowledge of the different forms of change that take place in organizations, and the processes entailed in leading and managing change. Using seminars and discussion groups, the course will cover change management frameworks and concepts, explore the nature and context of change, examine alternative change management approaches and examine how best to implement predetermined change strategies, especially in the context of digital disruption."

    "description": "Cyber physical systems are typically designed as a network of interacting elements with physical input and output, and are characterized by the interaction between the physical world (sensors, user inputs, actuators) and the cyber world (processing, decision making). Cyber physical systems are the driving force behind modern civilization, being integral part of technologies, such as additive manufacturing, smartcard-based payment, power delivery systems, drone-based operations, and smart home automation. Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards.\nIn this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid."

When malware breaches an organization's defences, the security team needs to act quickly to cure current infections and prevent it from re-occurring. Understanding the capabilities of the malware is critical to an organization's ability to quickly create a signature to prevent the widespread of the malware across the network, to block further communications from the attacker. This understanding could also be translated to valuable knowledge in identifying existing security gaps within an organization's system and fortify defences. This course aims to build a strong foundation to perform triage on malicious software using a variety of system and network monitoring utilities, a disassembler, a debugger and many other freely available tools."

This course concentrates on visual storytelling for cinema, television and multi-media. \n\nStory depends on solid structuring and the ability to utilise storytelling to awaken the imagination of the buyer, but first and foremost it is about emotion: generating the right degree of emotion and aligning that to company and product branding for given visual media. We therefore need to understand psychology and have real insight into people, not just as a persuasive tool, but a genuine understanding of what people's deepest desires are and how your brand delivers that desire. Having understood the tones, attitudes and empathy generated by your product, we must then structure well. There are two concepts we need to understand to convey this: striking the note of simplicity to engage the emotions and secondly basing those stories on timeless myths and storytelling principles. \n\nHaving instilled all this, we must then question the nature of advertising as a metacognitive process for the designer of commercials. This provides perspectives on the story being told and why we are compelled to tell it well. By viewing advertising examples from cinema, television and multi-media and investigating the myths and principles that underpin their success, this course reaches deep into the creativity of the student to grow beyond outmoded forms of selling and embrace the future of visual sales-personship.\n\nThe course therefore generates competency in storytelling for practitioners and researchers in the field of effective advertising.

Many typical avenues of raising funds (such as bank borrowing, issuance of bonds or liquid equities) for established or public-listed companies are usually not available to new and young ventures due to the latter?s lack of business track records. Hence, alternative fund raising avenues for new and young ventures need to be addressed. The analyses and requirements of professional investors in new and young ventures, in particular the venture capital funds, are very different from that of the public-equity investors or fund managers. This course will enable you to learn the approach to raising funds from the professional investors, and to understand the unique\nrequirements of the venture capital funds, so as to enhance the probability of securing funding for your venture.\nThis course is not only relevant for would-be entrepreneurs, but will also benefit students who intend to pursue a career in the venture capital industry or in corporate venture investments."

    "au": "3.0",
    "description": "This course is designed to provide students with an introduction to certain of the most important contributions to political theory made in the 20th century.  Although the texts studied will be presented more or less chronologically, we will consider them from a general thematic standpoint that interrogates the philosophical acumen of what has come to be established as the dominant political framework of our time:  liberalism.  We thus begin with John Dewey's radical reformulation of the liberal political tradition, in which he attempts to respond to what earlier critics of liberalism identified as its fundamentally ahistorical presuppositions, particularly its methodological individualism.  After familiarizing ourselves with Dewey's reconstruction of the liberal political tradition we will study a variety of thinkers who continue to question the legitimacy of the liberal understanding of the nature of the individual and political society.  Figures studied will include: the conservative German jurist and eventual Nazi apologist, Carl Schmitt; the pioneering psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud; the neo-Marxist Frankfurt School members, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer; the arguably unclassifiable thinker of the specificity of the political, Hannah Arendt; the revolutionary post-colonial thinker, Frantz Fanon; and the French post-structuralist historian and philosopher, Michel Foucault.  Finally, we will conclude the course by returning to the liberal tradition and examining two important essays by John Rawls ? the most important liberal philosopher since John Stuart Mill, and arguably the most influential political theorist of the 20th century - paying particular attention to Rawls' attempt to theorize a political liberalism sensitive to the fact of human difference.  Throughout the course of the semester students will be encouraged to put each of the thinkers into dialogue with one another, interrogating the ways in which the construction of specific theoretical constellations is able to reveal to us potential textual gaps and inconsistencies, but also new perspectives on how we think about political reality that might otherwise remain obscured.  Students will also be required to continually put the texts studied to work, that is, utilize them in order to attempt to shed critical light on their own political worlds and how they think about the nature of human existence and interaction."

    "au": "4.0",
    "description": "In this course you will examine a selection of some of the most influential contributions to the study of the intersection of psychoanalytic and political theory. Mostly eschewing Sigmund Freud's own political analyses, we begin with an investigation of some of the most notable articulations of his metapsychology, or the philosophy of the psychical apparatus. The psychoanalytic starting-point is the recognition of an unconscious, an inner subjective life that fundamentally structures our specifically human existence in indeterminate ways. This recognition poses fundamental challenges to various established models of political reason. It can no longer be taken for granted, for example, that political determinations may be potentially grounded in transparent and rational processes of reflection and deliberation that are capable of fully revealing to us our collective interests and goods. Rather, political theory must recognize the unconscious desires, emotions, affects, and motives that subterraneously influence our outward behaviours and orientations. Through the study of various 20th century clinical analysts as well as social theorists influenced by psychoanalysis - such as Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse, Norman O. Brown, Cornelius Castoriadis, Franz Fanon, and Jessica Benjamin -  we will investigate various important political issues complicated by the Freudian discovery of the unconscious, including the psychology of fascism, the desire for voluntary servitude, the nature of autonomy, the ground of gender hierarchy, and many more. After having completed the course you will have gained a deeper appreciation of the psychological factors and motivations which influence the decision-making of political actors."

The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include:\n\n1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains?\n\n2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now.\n\n3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.\n\nAll these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

Both subfields study focus on different dimensions of language change. In the diachronic dimension we seek answers to how and why languages change over time. In the synchronic dimension we classify languages into families and study situations which lead to language change. The course will cover both descriptive and theoretical components. A fair amount of time will be spent on mastering the descriptive tools to enable students to independently analyze patterns of language change. At the same time, a number of theoretical issues related to grammaticalization and language evolution will be discussed to introduce students to current debates in the field."

    "description": "The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical  terminology,  but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.\n\nThe course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.\n\nThe mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/)\n \nwill reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complex\norchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce\ndetailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  including\nthose discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention\nwill also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.\n\nThe course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.\n\nThe students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.\n\nThe final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.\n\nKey subjects covered include:\n1.\tusing  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  of\nspeech production and perception;\n2.\tthe relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms\nof speech production;\n3.\tan  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;\n4.\tan appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;\n5.\tpractice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data."

This course focuses on the examples found in premodern Asia. This course analyzes the myths and legends associated with heroes and heroines, and examines archaeological remains, such as statues, paintings, and temples linked to such individuals in conjunction with historical records. For the prehistoric period, archaeological remains provide important artifacts which can be used to hypothesize the importance and role of heroic beings, who would have been ancestor figures. As we get into the historical period, kings, queens, and other figures assumed important positions as heroic figures of authority who possessed spiritual powers. With the advent of world religions, for example, new archetypes were created, and new traits were qualities which members aim to emulate.

It examines how development in China and decolonization of the British Empire influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony.\n\nHong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong's future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between colonial Hong Kong, Britain and China via six inter-locking themes: imperial diplomacy, diplomatic end game, social order and colonial state-building, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of Hong Kong during the colonial era, useful insights in China's development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired."

In addition to covering major political developments, we will pay close attention to religious, intellectual, and social trends, as well as to changes in the material culture of ancient China. Throughout the course we will focus particularly on recent archaeological discoveries. Nearly eighty years of scientific archaeology in China has produced a wide array of data that have revolutionized our understanding of ancient history. As new texts and artifacts continue to be unearthed, historians struggle to reconcile this new knowledge about the past with a received historical tradition that goes back 2000 years. This tension between received historical knowledge and modern archaeology puts archaeology at the heart of fierce historiographic debates. This course will explore these issues by examining early Chinese history in light of major archaeological discoveries of texts and materials, discussing both the content of the discoveries and their impact on the historiography of ancient China."

This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer."
